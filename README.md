## Predicting demand in D.C. Capital Bikeshare network

This was a project I undertook for the Johns Hopkins Professional Development and Careers Office Data Science Fellowship Program.
Over 2 months, on a part-time basis, my goal was to build a forecasting model for the Capital Bikeshare rental bike scheme in Washington D.C.

A record of individual rides is [publicly released](https://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data) each month. 
I conducted my exploratory data analysis and model training using Sagemaker Studio Lab notebooks, Amazon's version of Google colab.
